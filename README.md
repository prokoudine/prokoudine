## Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I help tech companies navigate the content chaos and build long-lasting relationships with their customers through compelling case studies, whitepapers, blog posts, documentation, and video tutorials.

Here is some of my recent public work:

- **Ondsel (SaaS for mechanical engineers)**: content strategy and plan, writing and editing blog posts, initial user guide
- **FreeCAD (3D parametric CAD)**: writing and editing blog posts
- **Ardour (digital audio workstation)**: revamping and maintaining the documentation, making bite-sized video tutorials
- **PiKVM**: rewriting the quickstart guides to make them beginner-friendlier
- **Evidence (data analytics platform)**: writing blog posts
