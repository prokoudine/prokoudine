## Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I help tech companies navigate the content chaos and build long-lasting relationships with their customers through compelling case studies, whitepapers, blog posts, documentation, and video tutorials.

Here is some of my recent public work:

- **Ondsel (SaaS for mechanical engineers)**: content strategy and plan, blog posts, initial user guide.
- **FreeCAD (3D parametric CAD)**: blog posts.
- **Ardour (digital audio workstation)**: documentation maintenance, bite-sized video tutorials
- **PiKVM (Raspberry Pi based KVM devices)**: new, beginner-friendlier quickstart guides
- **Evidence (data analytics platform)**: blog posts
